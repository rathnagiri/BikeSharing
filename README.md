# BikeSharing Assignment
This assignment is a programming assignment to build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes.

# Business Background
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. 

# Consulting Expectation
The Consulation Analyst should understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. Specifically, Boom Bikes want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:

* Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
* How well those variables describe the bike demands
Based on various meteorological surveys and people's styles, the service provider firm has gathered a large dataset on daily bike demands across the American market based on some factors.

# Datasets used
1. Bike Sharing dataset: Day.csv
2. Data Dictionary: Readme.txt

# Solution file: python jupyter file: Giri_BikeSharing_Assignment.ipynb

# Subjective Questions PDF: Subjective_Questions_Answers.pdf

# Conclusion 
The Analysis on the provided dataset the following could be inferred:
Significant variables to predict the demand for shared bikes

1. year (2019)
2. temp
3. windspeed
4. season_Spring
5. season_Winter
6. month_Sep
7. Clear

Thus, the final model consists of the 7 variables mentioned above and the bikes rental company could go ahead with this model and use it for predicting count of daily bike rentals.
